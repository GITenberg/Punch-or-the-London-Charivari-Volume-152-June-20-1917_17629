<h1>PUNCH,<br />OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>
<h2>Vol. 152.</h2>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>
A man who purchased sandwiches at
a railway restaurant and afterwards
threw them into the road was fined five
shillings at Grimsby Police Court last
week. His explanation&mdash;that he did
not know they might injure the road&mdash;was
not accepted by the Court.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
We cannot help thinking that too
much fuss has been made about trying
to stop Messrs. <span class="sc">Ramsay Macdonald</span>
and <span class="sc">Jowett</span> from leaving England.
So far as we can gather they did not
threaten to return to this country afterwards.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
A North of England man, obviously
wishing to appear unusual,
still persists in the stupid
story that he did not hear
the Messines explosion.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
We can think of no finer
example of the humility of
true greatness than <span class="sc">King
Constantine's</span> decision to
abdicate.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
There were forty thousand
fewer paupers in 1916 than
in 1915, according to figures
recently published. The difference
is accounted for by
the number of revue-writers
who have resumed their agricultural
occupations.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
In a small town in Australia,
says a news item, over
two tons of mice were killed
in two days. For some unknown
reason, which perhaps
the Censor can explain, the
name of the cat is withheld.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Eliminate the middleman," demands
a contemporary. It might prove a simpler
affair, after all, than the present
system of suppressing the inner man.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Ginnell</span>, M.P., is responsible
for the statement that "bringing an
action against the police in Ireland is
like bringing one against Satan in hell."
The chief obstacle in the latter case is
of course the total absence of learned
counsel in that locality.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>, it appears, has lost no
time in commiserating with his troops
on their magnificent victory at Messines.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
The title which Mr. <span class="sc">John Hassall</span>
wrote under one of his sketches suggested
the words for a song which has
now been written. It is only fair to
the artist to say that he was not aware
that his quite innocent title would lead
to this.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
The National Service staff at St.
Ermin's Hotel, Westminster, has been
reduced by half. It is now expected
that the unemployed half will volunteer
for National Service.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Berlin announces that all through-lines
in  Germany are running. The
case of the <span class="sc">Hindenburg</span> Line seems to
be infectious.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"No cheese," says <i>The Evening News</i>,
"has quite the bite of Cheddar." At
the same time, unless it wags its tail
to show that it is friendly, we feel that
every cheese with a bite like that would
be much safer if muzzled.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Triplets were born in Manchester
last week. The father is going on as
well as can be expected.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Complaint has been made by a
member of the Hounslow Burial Committee
of courting couples occupying
seats in the cemetery. The killjoy!</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
We can only suppose it was the hot
weather that tempted a newsagent
correspondent to ask whether Lord
<span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> had gone to America on
"sail or return." </p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>, we are told, while staying
at Washington, visited eleven public
buildings and interviewed nine representative
Americans on one day. There
is some talk of his being elected an
honorary American.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
We wish to deny the foolish rumour
that when he arrived in London from
his American tour and was asked if he
had had a good voyage, he remarked,
"Sure thing, sonny. All the little
Mister Congressmen gathered around,
and it suited your Uncle Dudley very
nicely and some more. Yep!"</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
An old lady was recently fined two
pounds for putting out crumbs for
birds. Had the bread-crumbs been put
outside, instead of inside, the birds, no
offence, it seems, would have been
committed.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Newspapers in Germany may now
be sold only to subscribers for one
month or more. A similar measure for
England is opposed on the
ground that it would be most
inadvisable to check the practice
at present in vogue among
patriotic supporters of the
Coalition Government of buying
<i>The Morning Post</i> and <i>The
Daily News</i> on alternate days.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Bobbing for eels is being
pursued with much enthusiasm
on the Norfolk Broads.
Two-bobbing for haddocks in
Kensington is sport enough
for most of us.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Large numbers of the German
prisoners taken at Messines
wore new boots and new
uniforms. Other improvements
included a less ragged
rendering of the well-known
recitation, "Kamerad!"</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Asked what bait could be
used for coarse fish, the late
<span class="sc">Food-Controller</span> suggested one "made
from bran, with a limited quantity of
oatmeal." The correspondent has now
written to inquire whether the fish
have been officially informed of the
new diet.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Four shillings a hundredweight is
being paid for old omnibus tickets, but
there are still a few people who use
these vehicles for pleasure, without any
motive of gain.</p>

<li>
<span class="outdent">2. The Raid will</span> be carried out by the <span class="sc">Bill Sikes</span> and
<span class="sc">Robin Hood</span> Battalions. The <span class="sc">Charlie Peace</span> Bn. will be
in close support, and the <span class="sc">Dick Turpin</span> Bn. in reserve.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">3. The four sides</span> of the house will be attacked simultaneously,

<li>
<span class="outdent">5. Zero hour will</span> be notified later.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">6. The grounds</span> and approaches will be  reconnoitred

for legitimate plumbers, window-cleaners, piano-tuners,
etc., will be taken.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">7. The Brigades</span> on the Right and Left will co-operate
by starting a street fight and a small fire respectively at
some convenient distance from the scene of operations.</li>
<li>

established at a radius of 500 yards from the house, with
strong points at the street corners. "Q." will arrange for
a supply of hedging-gloves.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">9. The general</span> scheme of approach will be on the lines

of Attack" (OK 340/CV/429).</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent1">10. Commanding</span> Officers will submit a detailed scheme
for the attack (with sketch maps) not later than 4 P.M. on
August 6th.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent1">11. Mopping-up</span> parties will be detailed to deal with all
dug-outs known to be occupied. Prisoners will not be
taken, but undue roughness is to be discouraged as likely
to bring discredit upon the service. Steps will be taken,
however, to ensure the immediate, if temporary, silence
of the obstreperous. O.C. Chloroform will arrange.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent1">12. The Dog</span> emplacement at G 36 A 0.8 will be dealt
with by the Brigade Dog-fancier.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent1">13. Brigade Cooks</span> will be detailed in specified areas to
act as decoys for Policemen.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent1">14. All information</span> as to the plans, intentions, appearance,
habits and dispositions of inhabitants will be found
in Appendix I. Some good interior photographs of the
house have been obtained by Corps photographers acting
as window-cleaners.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent1">15. As foreshadowed</span> in the Self-help Corps Intelligence
Summary of June 29th most of the family will be away
at the seaside by the date fixed for the Raid.</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent1">16. A teetotal</span> Guard will be placed over all cellars.</li>

<span class="sc">Dearest Daphne</span>,&mdash;Juno ffarrington's
wedding to the Oldcastles' boy, Portcullis, the other day,
quite the best done of Allotment Weddings that are
having a little vogue just now. Juno's white satin gown was
embroidered with mustard and cress and spring onions in their
natural colours, her veil was kept in place by a coronal of
lettuce leaves, and, instead of a Prayer-Book or a posy, she
carried a little ivory-and-silver spade. The effect was <i>absolutely!</i>

chiffon; also they'd garden-hats, tied under the chin
with ribbon-grass and with a big cluster of radishes at the
left side, and each of them carried a bunch of small salad and
a darling little crystal-and-silver watering-pot (Portcullis's gifts).
The Duke of Southlands gave his daughter away, and Juno
<i>insisted</i> on his wearing a smock-frock and carrying a trowel, and
just as the dear Bishop said, "Who giveth this woman?"
the poor old darling dropped his trowel with a crash and rather
spoilt things.</p>
<p>
The wedding-cake was a great big war loaf stuck with flags.
Juno cut it in old-fashioned style with Portcullis's sword. While
we were doing ourselves well with war-bread and margarine,
boiled eggs and plenty of champagne, the Controller of Wedding
Breakfasts blew in (it's a new post, and he's two hundred
and fifty able-bodied young assistants). He was curious to see
what we were having, and cautioned us against throwing any
rice after our bride and 'groom. "But how absurd, you ricky
person!" chipped in Popsy, Lady Ramsgate, who, of course,
is Juno's great-aunt. "<i>We</i> never throw rice at our wedding-people! <i>That</i>'s only
done by the outlying tribes of barbarians." It was a pity she attracted
his notice, for he was down on her directly for having on a toque almost
entirely made of young turnips and carrots. He said it was "an infraction
of rule 150, cap. 4,500 of the Safety of the Empire Act, forbidding
the use of the people's food for personal adornment."</p>
<p>
The Allotment expression, which is the correct one now, is a look of interest
and expectation, because what one's planted is coming up. <i>Some</i> people
rather spoil their Allotment expression by a <i>puzzled</i> look. <i>Et pourquoi</i>?
dear, they've <i>quite</i> forgotten what they planted, and, though they <i>pretend</i> they
know <i>exactly</i> what it is that's coming up, they really haven't the slightest!</p>
<p>
My last photo is considered to show the Allotment expression in utter perfection.
(It's been in <i>People of Position, Mayfair Murmurs</i>, and several other
weeklies.) I'm standing in my potato-patch (my Allotment toilette is finished
off by a pair of <i>enthralling</i> little hob-nailed
boots!) and I'm holding a rake and a hoe and a digging-fork in one
hand and a garden-hose in the other; there's a wheel-barrow beside me, and
I'm looking at the potato-plants with the <i>true</i> Allotment smile, my
dearest. I sent a copy of this picky to Norty, and under it I
wrote those famous last words of some celebrated Frenchman
(I forget whether it was
<span class="sc">Molière</span> or <span class="sc">Mirabeau</span> or <span class="sc">Napoleon</span>):
"<i>Je vais chercher un grand peut-être</i>!"</p>

<h5>THE LAST STRAW.</h5>
</div>

<p>
Wee-Wee is frightfully worried about Bo-Bo being so
overworked. He used to be at the head of the Department for
Telling People What to Do, and he and his five hundred assistants
were worked half dead; and <i>now</i> he's at the head of a
still newer department, the one for Telling People What They're
<i>Not</i> to Do, and, though he's eight hundred clerks to help
him, Wee-Wee says the strain is too great for words. He goes
to Whitehall at ten every day and comes back at three! And
then he has the Long-Ago treatment that's being used so much
now for war-frayed nerves. The idea is to get people as far away
from the present as poss. So when Bo-Bo comes in from
Whitehall he lies down on a fearful old worm-eaten oak settle
in a dim room hung with moth-eaten tapestry, and Wee-Wee
reads <span class="sc">Chaucer</span> to him, and
sings ghastly little folk-songs, accompanying herself on a thing
called a <i>crwth</i>&mdash;(it's a tremendously
primitive sort of harp, but I can't believe that
even a <i>crwth</i> meant to make such a horrible noise as Wee-Wee
makes on it!). Myself, I don't consider Bo-Bo a bit the
better for the Long-Ago treatment, and there's certainly a
wild look in his eyes that wasn't there before!</p>
<p>
<i>M'amie</i>, would you like to hear the simply <i>odious</i> storyette
of Somebody's Cousin? Well, so you shall. Somebody is by way of
being an intimate foe of mine, and Somebody's Cousin has long been a
thorn in the flesh and a shaking of the head to his people. Before the War he
belonged to the League for Taking Everything Lying Down, the Fellowship
for Preventing People from Standing up against Foreign Aggression, and
the Brotherhood for Giving up All<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg 397]</span>
Our Advantages to Aliens. He was of military age, and when war came, after
giving vent to some completely detestable sentiments, he crossed to the U.S.
and naturalised himself there, constantly attacking the country that was
unlucky enough to produce him.</p>
<p>
When the U.S. came in, he shed his  citizenship in a hurry, fled to South
America, and naturalised himself in a  republic that had sworn by all its gods
to keep out of the War <i>à tout prix</i>. This republic, however, changed its
mind later and followed its big northern brother into the War, <i>et voilà</i>! Somebody's
Cousin was at a loose end again. He afterwards naturalised himself in
half-a-dozen small far-away nations that all finally came in, and <i>then,
chérie</i>, he drifted down to the islands of the South Pacific (the favourite ocean
of <i>his</i> sort!) and had himself made an Ollyoola. (The Ollyoolas are a tribe
that has <i>never in all its past history</i>  been known to go to war). He was
made an Ollyoola with all the native rites, dancing and shrieking and so on,
and he wore the correct Ollyoola dress (a few shells and his hair trained on
sticks to stand straight up).</p>
<p>
And <i>now</i> comes the point of this storyette: Only a few weeks after
Somebody's Cousin had become a full-blooded Ollyoola (I think that's the
proper phrase), the Ollyoolas suddenly fell out with the Patti-Tattis (on the
next island) and went to war, for <i>absolutely the first time</i>, with a <i>ferocity</i>, my
Daphne, that seems to have been saving up through all their centuries of peacefulness!</p>
<p>
Nothing's been heard since of Somebody's Cousin!</p>

<h2>THE DISSUADERS.</h2>
<p>
For many years&mdash;ever since the first
piece of chalk was applied to the first
wall and advertising began its bombastic
career&mdash;the advertiser's tendency
has been to commend his wares, if not
to excess, at any rate with no want of
generosity. Everyone must have noticed
it. But war changes many things
besides Cabinets, and if the paper
famine is to continue there will shortly
be a totally novel kind of advertising to
be seen, where dissuasion holds the
highest place. For unless something
happens those journals which have
already done much to reduce circulation
will have to do more and actually
decry themselves. Such counsels as
those which follow may before long
meet the eyes, and, it is possible, influence
the minds, of the great B.P.:&mdash;</p>

<h2>A LOCAL FOOD-CONTROLLER.</h2>
<p>
"No partner for you this evening,
Sir," said the Inspector. "Mr. Tibbits
has just telephoned through that he
has rheumatism badly again."</p>
<p>
I know Tibbits' rheumatism. I also
know he plays off his heat in the
club billiard handicap to-night. I can
imagine him writhing round the table.
Still I remember the first rule of the
force&mdash;under no circumstances give
another policeman away.</p>
<p>
"You'll have to take Dartmouth
Street by yourself, Sir," continues the
Inspector.</p>
<p>
"What's it like?"</p>
<p>
"Bit of a street market. All right&mdash;just
tact and keep them moving."</p>
<p>
I reach Dartmouth Street. It is a
thronged smelly thoroughfare. I pass
along modestly, hoping that every one
will ignore me.</p>
<p>
But a gentleman who is selling fish
detects me and calls "'Ere, Boss, move
this ole geezer on."</p>
<p>
"What's the trouble?" I inquire.</p>
<p>
The old geezer turns rapidly on me.
"'Ere 'e's gone and sold me two 'errings
for tuppence 'alfpenny which was that
salt my 'usband went near mad, what
with the pubs bein' shut all afternoon,
an' now 'e's popped the fender jus' to
get rid of 'is thirst."</p>
<p>
"I told you to soak 'em in three
waters," says the fishmonger.</p>
<p>
"'Ow much beer is my 'usband to
soak 'imself in&mdash;tell me that?"</p>
<p>
It is time for tact. I whisper in the
lady's ear, "Come along&mdash;don't argue
with a man like that. He's beneath
you."</p>
<p>
She comes away. I am triumphant.
But she turns round and cries, "This
gentleman as <i>is</i> a gentleman says I
ain't to lower meself by talkin' to a
'ound like you."</p>
<p>
I move on. I doubt if the fishmonger
will be pleased by the lady's representation
of my few words, and I make a
mental note to keep away from his stall.
All at once another lady, who for some
obscure reason is carrying a bucket,
grips me by the arm.</p>
<p>
"I'm goin' to 'ave the law on my
side, I am," she declares emphatically,
"an' then I'll smash 'is bloomin' fice
in."</p>
<p>
I am swayed towards a fruit-stall.</p>
<p>
"Look at them," says the irate lady,
holding out three potatoes. "Rotten&mdash;at
thrippence a pound. My 'usband
'e'd 'ave set abaht me if I'd give 'im
them for 'is dinner."</p>
<p>
The fruiterer takes a lofty moral
standard. "I sold yer them fer seed
pertaters, I did. If yer 'usband eats
them 'e's worse than a Un."</p>
<p>
"Seed pertaters, was they?  Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[pg 399]</span>
was I to grow 'em? In a mug on the
mantelpiece?"</p>
<p>
"'Ow was I ter know yer 'adn't a
'lotment?"</p>
<p>
"You'll need no 'lotment. It's a
cemet'ry you'll want when my 'usband
knows you've called 'im a Un."</p>
<p>
"Now, now," I interpose tactfully.
"Perhaps you can exchange them,
then you'll have the lady for a regular
customer."</p>
<p>
"I don't want the blighter fer a reglar
customer," says the fruiterer.</p>
<p>
Three potatoes whirl past me at the
fruiterer. The lady with the bucket
departs rapidly.</p>
<p>
"Lemme get at 'er," cries the irate
fruiterer.</p>
<p>
"You wouldn't hit a woman," I protest.</p>
<p>
"Wouldn't I?" says the infuriated
fruiterer.</p>
<p>
I interpose&mdash;verbally. "You'll get
everything stolen," I say, "from your
stall if you leave it."</p>
<p>
"I'll leave you in charge."</p>
<p>
"I'm needed down my beat," I reply,
and stalk on instantly, leaving a sadly
disillusioned man behind me.</p>
<p>
I reach a queue outside a grocer's
shop.</p>
<p>
"There now," says a stout lady,
"give 'er in charge."</p>
<p>
The queue all speak at once.</p>
<p>
"She's a 'oarder, she is. Got 'arf-a-pound
o' sugar already in 'er basket
and only 'erself and 'er 'usband at
'ome, while I got five kids."</p>
<p>
A lady down the queue caps this
with seven kids, and in the distance a
lady in a fur cap claims ten, and is at
once engaged by her neighbours in a
bitter controversy as to whether three in
France should count in sugar buying.</p>
<p>
All the time the hoarder stands with
nose in the air, the picture of lofty
indifference.</p>
<p>
Tact&mdash;tact&mdash;I remember the Inspector's
advice.</p>
<p>
"Excuse me, Madam," I say, "but
in these times we all have to make
sacrifices. You already have sugar.
Some of your friends have none. Under
the circumstances&mdash;"</p>
<p>
Slowly the lady turns a withering
eye on me. "I'll move nowhere no'ow
for nobody."</p>
<p>
A lady in the background suggests
that the female should be boiled in a
sugar-sack. A more humane person
expresses the hope that she will be
bombed that night.</p>
<p>
"But, Madam, consider your friends,"
I proceed.</p>
<p>
"Don't you call that lot my friends!
I'm 'ere fer a pound of marge, and get
it I will if all the bloomin' speshuls
come 'oo 're doin' reglar coppers outer
jobs."</p>
<p>
Public opinion in the queue takes a
sudden turn.  One lady remarks that
these speshuls are that interfering.
Another alleges that she has no doubt
I have sacks of sugar at home.</p>
<p>
I remember the Inspector's counsel
about moving on, and move myself on.</p>
<p>
There is one man in England who
proclaims himself absolutely unfitted to
fill the Food-Controller's position.</p>
<p>
I am that modest person.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p>
<i>Monday, June 11th</i>.&mdash;I am told that
it was <span class="sc">Willie Redmond's</span> ambition to
be the Father of the House; indeed, that
by some arithmetical process peculiar
to himself be claimed, although only
elected in 1883, to be already entitled
to that venerable honour.</p>
<p>
In reality he was the Eternal Boy,
from the far-off time when it was his
nightly delight with youthful exuberance
to cheek Mr. Speaker <span class="sc">Brand</span>
until the moment of his glorious death
in Flanders, whither he had gone at an
age when most of his compeers were
content to play the critic in a snug
corner of the smoking-room.</p>
<p>
Personal affection combined with
admiration for his gallantry to inspire
the speeches in which the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> and Sir <span class="sc">Edward
Carson</span> enshrined the most remarkable
tribute ever paid to a private
Member.</p>
<p>
Sir <span class="sc">George Greenwood's</span> affection
for the animal creation is commonly
supposed to be such that he would
not countenance the slaughter of the
meanest thing that crawls&mdash;not even
those miserable creatures who hold
that <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span> plays were written
by <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>. It was therefore with
pained regret that I heard him attempting
to support his objection to the
activities of sparrow-clubs by the argument
that, if the birds were destroyed,
large numbers of grubs and caterpillars
would be left alive. After this
I shall not be surprised to hear that he
has been summoned by the R.S.P.C.A.
for brutality to a slug.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><i>In Re</i> An action against Satan</span>.</p>

<p>(<span class="sc">Mr. H.E. Duke</span>, K.C.)</p>
</div>

<p>
What I most admire in the <span class="sc">Chief
Secretary for Ireland</span> is his wonderful
self-restraint. When Mr. <span class="sc">Ginnell</span>
stridently inquired whether to institute
legal process against the police in
Ireland was not like bringing an action
against Satan in hell, the ordinary
man would have been tempted to reply:
"The hon. Member probably has sources
of information not accessible to me."
Mr. <span class="sc">Duke</span> contented himself with mildly
suggesting that the hon. Member should
"apply his own intelligence to that
matter." Perhaps, however, he meant
much the same thing.</p>

<p>
Half the sitting was taken up with
discussing whether Messrs. <span class="sc">Jowett</span> and
<span class="sc">Ramsay Macdonald</span> should be given
passports to Russia. Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>
clinched the matter by saying that the
Russian Government wanted them.
Well, <i>de gustibus</i>, etc.</p>
<p>
<i>Tuesday, June 12th</i>.&mdash;Perhaps the
most wonderful revelation of the War
has been the adaptability of the British
working-man. Mr. <span class="sc">Cathcart Wason</span>
called attention to the case of a professional
gardener who, having been
recruited for home service, had first
been turned into a bricklayer's assistant,
then into an assistant-dresser, and
finally into a munition-maker. For
some time the Ministry of Munitions
seems to have been loth to part with
the services of this Admirable Crichton,
but having learned from the Board
of Agriculture that there was a shortage
of food it has now consented to
restore him to his original vocation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Captain Bathurst refuses to be
a potato prophet</span>.</p></div>


<p>
It will be a thousand pities if Captain
<span class="sc">Bathurst</span> should persist in leaving the
department of the <span class="sc">Food-Controller</span>.
If he could only keep down food-prices
as effectively as he does irrelevant
questioners he would be worth his
weight in "Bradburys." His latest
victim is Mr. <span class="sc">Pennefather</span>, who has
developed a keen curiosity on the subject
of potatoes. Did not the Government
think that the high price would
cause premature "lifting"? Were they
aware that potatoes could be used
for making rubber substitutes and
cement; and would they assure the
House that there would be an abundance
of them for the next twelve
months'? Captain <span class="sc">Bathurst</span> declined
to figure in the <i>rôle</i> of prophet, and,
for the rest, remarked that the hon.
Member appeared to have an insatiable
appetite for <i>crambe repetita</i>. Mr.
<span class="sc">Pennefather</span> is understood to be still
searching the Encyclopædia to discover
the properties of this vegetable, with
the view of putting a few posers on the
subject to Captain <span class="sc">Bathurst</span> (or his
successor) next week.</p>
<p>
As the friends of Proportional Representation
are wont to refer to their
little pet by the affectionate diminutive
of "P.R.," they can hardly be surprised
that its appearance should lead
to combats recalling in intensity the
palmy days of the Prize Ring. It was
designed that the Front Bench should
be content to perform the function of
judicious bottle-holder, and leave the
issue to be fought out by the rest of the
House. But Sir F.E. <span class="sc">Smith</span>, like the
Irishman who inquired, "Is this a
private fight, or may anyone join in?"
could not refrain from trailing his coat,
and quickly found a doughty opponent
in Mr. <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span>. The House so
much enjoyed the unusual freedom of
the fight that it would probably be
going on still but for that spoil-sport,
the <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span>, who begged
Members to come to a decision. By
149 votes to 141 "P.R." was "down
and out."</p>

<p>HEAVY WORK FOR THE BOUNDARY COMISSIONERS.</p>

<p><span class="sc">MR. Eugene Wason to be swept away</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Eugene Wason</span> entered an anticipatory
protest against the possibility
that Scotland might be deprived of
some of her seventy-two Members. "I
myself," he said, "represent two whole
counties, Clackmannan and Kinross,
and I have a bit of Stirling and Perth
and West Fife, and I am told I am to
be swept out of existence." Gazing at
his ample proportions the House felt
that the Boundary Commissioners will
have their work cut out for them.</p>
<p>
<i>Wednesday, June 13th</i>.&mdash;Considering
that barely three hours before the House
met the "Fort of London" had been
drenched with the "ghastly dew of
aerial navies" Members showed themselves
most uncommon calm. They
exhibited, however, a little extra interest
when any prominent personage
entered the House, showing that he at
least had escaped the bombs, and were
too busy comparing notes regarding
their personal experiences to ask many
Supplementary Questions.</p>
<p>
Even Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law's</span> announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[pg 403]</span>
that <span class="sc">King Constantine</span> had
abdicated the throne of Greece passed
almost without remark; except that Mr.
<span class="sc">Swift MacNeill</span> anxiously inquired
whether Tino, having received the
Order of the Boot, would be allowed
to retain that of the Bath.</p>
<p>
The mystery of Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe's</span>
visit to the United States has been
cleared up. Certain journals, believed
to enjoy his confidence, had described
him as "Mr. Balfour's successor."
Certain other journals, whose confidence
he does not enjoy, had declined
to believe this. The fact, as stated by
Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>, is that "it is hoped
that Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> will be able
to carry on the work begun by Mr.
<span class="sc">Balfour</span> as head of the British Mission
in America." He is expected "to co-ordinate
and supervise the work of all
the Departmental Missions." It was
interesting to learn that his Lordship
"will have the right of communicating
direct with the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>"&mdash;a
thing which of course he has never
done before.</p>
<p>
<i>Thursday, June 14th</i>.&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Keating</span>,
having made the remarkable discovery
that the War has injured the prosperity
of Irish seaside resorts, demanded the
restoration of excursion trains and
season tickets. Mr. <span class="sc">George Roberts</span>
stoutly supported the Irish Railway
Executive Committee in its refusal to
encourage pleasure-traffic. His decision
received the involuntary support of Mr.
<span class="sc">MacVeagh</span>, who attempted to back up
his colleague by the singular argument
that the existing trains in Ireland ran
half-empty.</p>
<p>
The Lords spent the best part of a
sunny afternoon in discussing whether
or not the South-Eastern Eailway
should be allowed to bolster up the
Charing Cross railway bridge. In vain
Lord <span class="sc">Curzon</span>, flying in the face of his
Ministerial colleague, the <span class="sc">President
of the Board of Trade</span>, urged the
claims of Art; in vain he assured the
House that when <span class="sc">Wordsworth</span> wrote
of the view from Westminster, "Earth
has not anything to show more fair,"
he was not thinking of that maroon-coloured
monstrosity. The majority of
their lordships, understanding that the
proposal had something to do with
"strengthening the piers," declined to
reject it.</p>

<h2>THE INFANTICIDE.</h2>
<p>
From an economic point of view it
was inexcusable. I can only hope that
the affair will never reach the ear of
the new <span class="sc">Food-Controller</span>. The chief
culprit was undoubtedly Joan minor&mdash;I
only became an accomplice after the
fact&mdash;and I can scarcely believe that
even a Food-Controller could be very
angry with Joan minor. For one thing
she really is so very minor. And then
there's her manner; in face of it severity,
as I have found, is out of the
question. Even Joan major, who has
been known to rout our charlady in
single combat, finds it irresistible. Indeed
when I taxed her with having
a hand in the crime she secured an
acquittal on the plea of duress.</p>
<p>
Ever since Joan minor arrived at
years of understanding the weeks preceding
the great day have been fraught
with a mystery in which I have no
share. Earnest conversations which
break off guiltily the moment I enter
the room; strained whisperings and
now and again little uncontrollable
giggles of ecstatic anticipation from
Joan minor&mdash;these are the signs that I
have learned to look for, and, being
well versed in my part, to ignore with a
sublime unconsciousness which should
make my fortune in a melodrama of
stage asides. And then, on the morning
of my birthday, the solemn ceremonial
of revelation, I would come in to breakfast,
to find a parcel lying by my
plate. At first I would not see it. In
a tense and unnatural silence Joan
minor would follow me with her eyes
while I opened the window a few inches,
closed it again, stroked the cat and
generally behaved as though sitting
down at table was the last thing I intended.
Then, when I did take my place,
"The post is early to-day," I would
say, pushing the parcel carelessly on
one side as I took up the paper, while
Joan minor hid her face in Joan major's
blouse lest her feelings should betray
her into premature speech. And at
last I would open it, and my amazement
and delight would know no
bounds. There was very little acting
needed for that. It is no small thing
to be spirited back to the age when
birthdays really matter.</p>
<p>
And so this year it was with a feeling
of having been cheated that I left
the house for the office, where, in company
with other old fogies and girl
clerks, I do my unambitious bit towards
downing the Hun. The premonitory
symptoms had seemed to me unusually
acute, but the morning had brought
no parcel. My years weighed on my
shoulders again, and I am afraid I was
more than a little tart with my typist.</p>
<p>
I was kept late for dinner, and when
I entered the room I found Joan minor
sitting in her place, her eyes bright
with expectation. Beside my place
was a covered muffin dish. There
was no dallying with the pleasure this
time, for I had suddenly become young
again, and could not have waited had
I tried. I lifted the cover, and there,
about the size of a well-nourished pea,
lay the first-fruit of Joan minor's peculiar
and personal allotment, prepared,
planted and dug by Joan minor's own
hands, a veritable and unmistakable
potato.</p>

<h2>THE HAT AND THE VISIT.</h2>
<p>
"Francesca," I said, "does my hat really look all right?"</p>
<p>
When I put this momentous question we were in a train,
being bound on a visit to Frederick at his preparatory
school. A sudden doubt had just assailed me as to my
presentability. Should I, as a father, be looked upon as a
credit or a disgrace to my son? Francesca took some time
before she answered my question. Then she spoke.</p>
<p>
"Your hat," she said, "is well enough."</p>
<p>
"I see what it is," I said; "you think I ought to have
worn a top-hat. There are still occasions when a top-hat
may, nay, must be worn; and this, you think, is one of
them. There are solemnities and venerations that only a
top-hat can inspire in the naturally irreverent mind of
youth. A father in any other hat is a ridiculously youthful
object and has no business to inflict himself on his son.
Very well. I would not for worlds spoil Frederick's half-holiday
by shaming him in the eyes of his schoolfellows."</p>
<p>
"What do you propose to do about it, then? You can't
alter your hat now."</p>
<p>
"No," I said, "I can't; but I can get out of the train at
the next station and go home and leave you in your comparative
spickness and your relative spanness to spend your
afternoon with the boy. Or, stay, there must be a shop in
Belfield where top-hats can be bought. It is a cathedral
city and possesses dignitaries of the Church who still wear
top-hats, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"But those are special top-hats. You couldn't go to
Frederick in a bishop's hat, now could you?"</p>
<p>
"No-o-o," I said doubtfully, "perhaps I couldn't. But
suppose I wore the gaiters too&mdash;wouldn't that make it
all right?"</p>
<p>
"I should like," she said, "to see Frederick's face on
perceiving the new bishop."</p>
<p>
"Francesca," I said, "you talk as if no boys ever had
bishops for their fathers. Let me assure you, on the contrary,
that there are many bishops who have large families
of both sexes. I once stayed with a bishop, and I never
heard anybody attempt to make a mockery of his gaiters."</p>
<p>
"But they were his own. He couldn't be a bishop
without them."</p>
<p>
"That fact doesn't render them immune from laughter.
My present hat, for instance, is my own, and yet you have
been laughing at it ever since I called your attention to it."</p>
<p>
"Not at all; I have been admiring it. I said it was well
enough, and so it is. What more can you want?"</p>
<p>
"I only hope," I said, "that Frederick will think so too.
It would be too painful to dash the cup of half-holiday joy
from a boy's lips by wearing an inappropriate hat."</p>
<p>
"You're too nervous altogether about the impression
you're going to make on Frederick. Take example by me.
I've got a hat on."</p>
<p>
"You have," I said fervently. "It has grazed my face
more than once."</p>
<p>
"It is feeding," she said, "on your damask cheek. But
I'm quite calm in spite of it."</p>
<p>
"But then," I said, "you never knew Rowell."</p>
<p>
"No. Who was he?"</p>
<p>
"Rowell," I said, "was a schoolfellow of mine, and he
had a father."</p>
<p>
"Marvellous! And a mother too, I suppose."</p>
<p>
"Yes," I said, "but she doesn't come into the story.
Rowell's father had a passion, it appears, for riding, and
one dreadful afternoon, when we were playing cricket, he
rode into the cricket-field. <i>He was wearing trousers, and
his trousers had rucked up to his knees.</i> It was a terrific
sight, and, though we all pretended not to see and were
very sorry for young Rowell, he felt the blow most keenly.
I hope my hat won't be like Rowell's father's trousers."</p>
<p>
"It isn't a bit like them yet," said Francesca.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class="center">
(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.) </p>
<p>
It is my deliberate verdict that Mr. E.F. <span class="sc">Benson</span> is (as
my old nurse used to express it) "in league with Somebody
he oughtn't." I hope, however, that he will understand
this for the extorted compliment that it is, and not magic
me into something unpleasant, or (more probably) write
another book to prove to my own dissatisfaction that I am
everything I least wish to be. That indeed is the gravamen
of my charge: the diabolic ingenuity with which he makes
not so much our pleasant vices as our little almost-virtues
into whips to scourge us with. All this has been wrung
from me by the perusal of <i>Mr. Teddy</i> (<span class="sc">Fisher Unwin</span>).
Even now I can't make up my mind whether I like it or
not. The first half, which might be called a satire on the
folly of being forty and not realising it, depressed me profoundly.
I need not perhaps enlarge upon the reason.
Later, Mr. <span class="sc">Benson</span> made a very clever return upon the
theme; and, with a touch of real beauty, brought solace to
poor <i>Mr. Teddy</i> and consolation to the middle-aged reader.
I need give you only a slight indication of the plot, which
is simplicity itself. Into the self-contained little community
of a provincial society, where to have once been
young is to retain a courtesy title to perpetual youth, there
arrives suddenly the genuine article, a boy and girl still in
the springtime of life, by contrast with whom the preserved
immaturity of <i>Mr. Teddy</i> and his partner, <i>Miss Daisy</i>, is
shown for an artificial substitute. Baldly stated, the thesis
sounds cynical and a little cruel; actually, however, you
will here find Mr. <span class="sc">Benson</span> in a kindlier mood than he sometimes
consents to indulge. He displays, indeed, more than
a little fondness for his disillusioned hero; the fine spirit
with which <i>Mr. Teddy</i> faces at last the inevitable is a sure
proof of the author's sympathy.</p>

   <hr />
<p>
You will hardly have traversed the passages of our underground
railway system without being hurriedly aware in
passing of a picture in reds and browns, representing a
faun-like figure piping to an audience of three rather self-conscious
rabbits. This pleasing group does not portray
an actual scene from <i>Autumn</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>), but is rather to be
taken as symbolic of the atmosphere of Miss <span class="sc">Muriel
Hine's</span> latest book. The faun, I imagine, stands for <i>Rollo</i>,
the middle-aged lover of the country, into whose happy life
other, more human, loves break with such devastation.
What the rabbits mean is a more difficult problem. I jest;
but as a matter of fact I should be the first to admit that
Miss <span class="sc">Hine</span> has written a story that, despite a certain
crudity of colouring, is both unconventional and alive. The
attitude of the characters towards their parents, for example,
is at least original. <i>Deirdre</i>, the heroine, frankly despised her
mother, to whom she owed a marriage with the man whom
she hated. The gift of a country cottage enabled her to
escape from him to rabbits (figurative) and the simpler
life. There, however, she fell in with <i>Rollo</i>, who loved her
at sight, and whose daughter, <i>Hyacinth</i>, adored her father,
but quite blandly deceived him about her own amorous
adventures. A pretty tangle, you observe, and I am not
sure that I can wholly acquit the author of some cowardice
in her manner of cutting it. But undoubtedly <i>Autumn</i>
remains a story to read, and remember.</p>

   <hr />
<p>
Since Mr. H. <span class="sc">Perry Robinson's</span> name must be familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[pg 408]</span>
to most of us by now as that of one of the very select company
of journalists who monopolise seats at the Front, one
naturally turns with interest from his daily despatches to a
sustained narrative. His account of last year's battle of the
Somme, which he names <i>The Turning Point</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>),
is as lively and vigorous a recital as can well be imagined
of events hardly the less thrilling because already well-known.
Although he disclaims expert knowledge of strategies,
he is at least uncommonly well qualified to appraise
the things he saw. "Before July, 1916, our Army," he says,
"was like a small hoy hoping to grow up and be big enough
to lick a bully some day. Told to attack him before he felt
sure of his own strength, the small boy would not have
been sorry to wait a bit longer, but the pressure against
Verdun and against the Russians had to be relieved, and so
with steadily increasing skill and confidence the attack was
made, and day after day fresh units proved themselves
more than a match for the enemy."  The result was a
series of victories&mdash;Mametz, Contalmaison, Pozières, Guillemont,
Thiepval, Beaumont-Hamel&mdash;and the writer is able
to associate with each immortal name the regiments
there engaged, all heroes, for "there were no stragglers."
Indeed, if there is a weakness in the book it is that the
insistent recording of the individual heroism of different
battalions tends to become monotonous. But what a fault!
It is a monotony of Britishvalour crowned by a monotony
of British triumph.</p>

   <hr />
<p>
A point that will hardly avoid your notice in the plot
of <i>In the Night</i> (<span class="sc">Longmans</span>),
by Mr. R. <span class="sc">Gorell Barnes</span>
(now Lord <span class="sc">Gorell</span>), is the
exiguous part played in its elucidation by the Great
Investigator, who (as usual) happens to be on the spot
and able to place his services at the disposal of the local
authorities. It is, I suppose due to the Sherlockian tradition
these unhappy persons, the local detectives,
must always be supplemented by a superior and
high-handed expert. I think, from his preface, that the
author does not quite share my own taste in such
matters, since he promises that his Investigator shall
keep no secrets and observe nothing withheld from the
eye of the reader. So faithful is the author to this undertaking
that he practically keeps his expert hanging about
with the unenlightened crowd, while another character, in
light-hearted amateur enthusiasm, does all the work. But
of course, in a tale of this kind, the only thing that really
matters is the one question of spotting the criminal, or
who killed Cock Robin. Naturally I am not going to
spoil your fun over this by any officious whisperings. As
you probably know, the one safe rule in such matters is to
concentrate upon Cæsar's wife; and even in repeating this
antique maxim I may have betrayed too much. Forget it,
and you may find what happened <i>In the Night</i> a sufficiently
intriguing problem to provide a pleasant bedtime entertainment
that will leave your subsequent repose unimpaired.</p>

   <hr />
<p>
In deciding to add to what one may call the fiction of
Metropolitan Adventures, whereof <i>The New Arabian Nights</i>
may be regarded as both the model and the prototype, the
author of <i>The London Nights of Belsize</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) has undertaken
a task which is both easy and difficult&mdash;easy because
a sophisticated style and a lively imagination are the only
essential qualifications, and difficult because it involves
competition with a perfect galaxy of distinguished authors.
There is always room for more of it, however, and, if
Mr. <span class="sc">Vernon Rendall</span> disappoints us, it is not merely
because the standard has been set unusually high. His
style is smooth and assured, and, though somewhat lacking
in humour, his touch is light and pleasing. He begins
well and interests us in his principal character so that we
look forward with zest to the adventures of a personality
which is everything that this sort of fiction requires.
Here unfortunately the matter ends. <i>Belsize</i>, who promises
so much, has no adventures worth the name. It is true
that he rescues the <i>Prince of Mingrelia</i>, runs to earth a
gang of highly-educated and æsthetic criminals, and does
other things that we properly expect such men to do. But
there is no excitement about his methods. Not to put too
fine a point on it, the author of <i>Belsize</i> lacks the true imagination
that makes the unreal seem real&mdash;a very different
thing from the imagination which merely clothes realities
in a garment of mystery. Notwithstanding this defect, <i>The
London Nights of Belsize</i>  should wile away an hour or
so very pleasantly.</p>

   <hr />
<p>
If <i>A Regimental Surgeon in War and Prison</i> (<span class="sc">Murray</span>)
does not create so profound an impression as it would have done two years ago,
the reason must be that our capacity for disgust at Hunnish
cruelty is exhausted by the demands already made
upon it. Captain <span class="sc">Dolbey</span> was in the Mons retreat and
assisted at what he calls "the Miracle of the Marne,"
and in writing of these events he shows a real knowledge
of both friend and foe. Taken prisoner under circumstances
entirely creditable to himself, he saw the inside
of German prison-camps, and suffered the indignities
and horrors for which these places have so justly become
infamous. His experiences are described with an almost
judicial calmness. In one case of childish revenge I trust
that the sufferers were sustained by a sense of humour.
When the picture of a "Prussian family having its morning
hate" appeared, the prisoners were punished by having their
deck-chairs confiscated. Mr. Punch, while deeply regretting
this vicarious expiation of his offence, cannot help
deriving some solace from the thought that he succeeded
in penetrating the hide of these Teuton pachyderms. When,
for a change, Captain <span class="sc">Dolbey</span> received a kindness from
German hands he acknowledges it frankly. He also makes
one or two suggestions which I sincerely hope will be considered
by those who are in a position to deal with them.
Altogether an illuminating book.</p>

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
